  {"post": "Honey, maple syrup, dates, all kinds of dried fruits such as raisins, figs, blueberries, any fruit that has a natural sweetness, in the worst case if you do not have such brown sugar or sweetened milk such as condensed milk.The flours you can use for dessert cakes such as cakes, tops or muffins are also quite diverse. For example, wholemeal flour, einkorn flour, chickpeas and others. Dr. Variant is a swamp of nuts. The variety here is again great â€“ walnuts, almonds, cashew hazelnuts.For example, 150 grams of dates is the equivalent of sugar swamp substitute that you can use when it comes to honey, but its value here can vary widely depending on your preferences. Keep in mind that honey is quite high in calories, but on the other hand it has a wide variety of vitamins and minerals."}

    <p>Thinking about the problems that most people face when they want to lose weight motivates me to write this article, which will provide you with some of the most important guidelines to follow when following a certain diet plan, regardless of its type.Mistake number 1. Good choice, food quality, but too large portions. You have chosen to eat the healthiest foods such as vegetables, legumes and more. This all sounds great, but if you do not follow the portion norm despite your choice, it would not have an effect on weight loss, because healthy food can also be high in calories.</p>

    <p>A few days until Christmas and I want to delight you with a Christmas sweet temptation but without sugar and without baking, easily and quickly and also useful. I like to prepare short and quick recipes that are not only very tasty but also useful for our health. Food is extremely important for how we look,if we are healthy and even how susceptible we are to disease.About a year ago I started my journey to a healthy lifestyle which was born from my desire to lead a more natural lifestyle. The first reason I started this blog was actually to be able to inspire others like me to change their lifestyle. I believe that when we  want something  and works for it, we achieves it. My journey in the world of nature began with my desire to produce my own cosmetics from scratch. Pure and real in which there is no intervention of modern chemical compounds. Thus was born the idea of own business.You can check all my products here After that, however, my interest did not stop there, but developed into something even more useful -healthy eating and lifestyle.</p>

  <div class='article-img'><img src='https://prioritycosmetics.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/ec134d123c42999f469925192052fb87.0.jpg?w=1024'></div>
  <p>I love to eat dark chocolate, and this month I have the opportunity to celebrate 1 year since the creation of Priority cosmeticsI‚Äôm serving you a recipe for coconut dark chocolate that will amaze you how easy it is, you can spin it like this while preparing lunch üòçüòÄ and here‚Äôs a dessert.

    Cocoa is one of the richest natural sources of polyphenols and in this recipe we use natural cocoa. So much so that chocolate even surpasses acai berry, pomegranate, cranberries and cranberries in polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity.
    The tree that produces cocoa grows in tropical climates, and its seeds are finely ground and low in oil. Its beans are widely used and preferred, but in addition to them, cocoa peel and oil have been used since ancient times to treat various skin diseases, intestinal problems and various wounds.</p>
